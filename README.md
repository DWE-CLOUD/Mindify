# Mindify : Transforming spoken thoughts into visual masterpieces.

![voice_ideation](https://github.com/DWE-CLOUD/Mindify/assets/85799123/9b0d2f32-765c-48b1-9b5a-ca673d75a694)

## Features

- Voice-powered input for seamless idea capture
- Intelligent chunking and organization of spoken ideas
- Real-time visualization of ideas in a dynamic graph format
- Efficient processing and API usage for optimal performance
- Filler sentence detection and filtering for clarity
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction

## How It Works

1. Users speak their ideas and thoughts freely while Mindify listens and captures the audio input.
2. The application applies advanced speech recognition and chunking techniques to extract coherent ideas from the live speech.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used to analyze the extracted ideas, determine their similarity, and create meaningful connections.
4. The organized ideas are visualized in a dynamic graph format, allowing users to explore and interact with their brainstorming session.
5. Users can further refine and manipulate the idea graph, merging nodes, filtering filler sentences, and adjusting the layout for optimal clarity.
